# Terror_types_survey
Data files and figures of the analyses conducted in the manuscript: "Unpacking public perceptions of terrorism: Does type of attack matters?" *Studies in Conflict & Terrorism*, (2020).    

The study focuses on the structure of survey questions and it may reflect public perceptions of terrorism threats.  

I unpack survey items and assess variations in public opinion regarding cyber and conventional terrorism.  

The repo includes analyses of national representative survey data collected in 2016.
