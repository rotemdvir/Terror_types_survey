Data files and figures of the analyses conducted in the manuscript: "Unpacking public perceptions of terrorism: Does type of attack matters?"  

The study focuses on the structure of survey questions and it may reflect public perceptions of terrorism threats.  

I unpack survey items and assess variations in public opinion regarding cyber and conventional terrorism. The repository includes analyses of national representative survey data collected in 2016.
